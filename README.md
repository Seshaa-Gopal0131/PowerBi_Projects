🚀 End-to-End Data Analysis Project | HR Analytics Power BI Project
This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project focused on HR Analytics using Power BI. The project involves real-life use cases and real datasets, demonstrating the process of building a comprehensive HR dashboard to track employee attendance, working preferences, and other key HR metrics.

📝 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a real HR dataset to create insightful dashboards in Power BI. The dataset includes three months of employee attendance data, with randomized employee names and IDs for privacy. The goal is to understand various HR metrics like working preferences (work from home vs. office), sick leave patterns, and employee attendance rates.
